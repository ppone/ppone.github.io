<p>There are two type of developers that your startup needs.  One that has experience in the technologies you are using or can come to speed very quickly and can create a new app, service, or function fast prefabably using a TDD (test driven development) approach. This developer would also be good at refining and making concrete ambigous business requirements through due diligence.   They should be also good at or come to speed very quickly in writing clean modular code, with proper unit tests.

</p>
 
<p>    
The other type of developer you need is one that writes clean, algorithmically efficient code. They should have a strong grasp of data structure and algorithms.  This developer should refactor any pieace of code that is not efficient and/or modular, and add to the unit tests in place if needed.

</p>

<p>
Ideally both of these developers would be the same person, but that is not always the case.   The first developer might be really bad at algorithmic challenges but might be able to develop a iOS app in relatively short amount of time.  The second developer might be redline Topcoder but might take an extraordinary amount of time to create a simple iOS app.

</p>

<p>
Having these two  type of developers work together is key.  One developer can teach the other how to write a simple iOS app in fast manner, and the other developer can show the other how to improve the performance and memory/space usage through the use of efficient algorihtms and data structures.  It not only becomes a win-win situations for both of the developers in terms of skill improvement, but results in the company developing the app or feature faster without the inefficient technical debt that might be show stopper in the future.

</p>

<p>
**Note: I mention modular and not object oriented, because not all solutions need an object oriented approach and not all programming languages (such as Go) necessarily support this paradigm.
