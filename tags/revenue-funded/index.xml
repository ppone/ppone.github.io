      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this environment of excess capital it can sometimes go against the grain to be self-funded.  Strangely most people who have bootstrapped businesses before seem to be also advocating for startups to take capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be quite dangerous.  With funding you can build many facets of business except for the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With funding you may easily think that you can go from 0 to 10. However you in most cases, unless you have done it before you will be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship is such that you cannot skip levels.  Level zero might involve you using a hard skill to grow and promote your business.&lt;/p&gt;
